# Twitter Front End Project

It is a fully functioning Front-End for a Twitter clone with ReactJS.

This project contains:
* Setup the project with create-react-app
* Build basic React components
* Add state to React components
* Fetch data from an external API
* Style the application

This project can be divided into two parts: getting the data and rendering the data in the page.

## Getting the data:

use the `async()`  to get the data and update in data by `useSate()` .

## Rendering
* use the `map()` to iterate and transfer the items in data as `props()`  to Tweet.js.
* Rendering the results by `Card` from `react-bootstrap` and adjust the final page by `CSS` .
